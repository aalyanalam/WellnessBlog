# Wellness Blog

Developed a wellness blog website dedicated to fostering discussions on mental health and fitness. 
Users are able to create their own account with a username and password which are stored in a MongoDB
database. Users are then able to view other blogs or create their own. When creating a blog, users are 
able to add a title, header, description and a cover picture. Used React to create an aesthetic user interface
and homepage. The frontend side was then deployed using EC2 from AWS.
